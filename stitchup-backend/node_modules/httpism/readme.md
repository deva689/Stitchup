# httpism [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/httpism.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/httpism) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/httpism.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/httpism) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/featurist/httpism.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/featurist/httpism)

httpism is a node and browser HTTP client that does a few things differently:

* **middleware**: customise a HTTP client for your API by sticking together middleware, for example, for content handlers or authentication schemes.
* **hypermedia**: responses can be used to make further requests relative to the response URI, just like a browser.
* **useful by default**: sends and receives JSON, throws exceptions on 400-500s, follows redirects. Of course, you can disable this stuff when it gets in your way, or hit raw HTTP and streams when you need to get clever.
* **promises**: no messing about with callbacks.
* for **browser** and **server** alike.

## NPM: [httpism](https://www.npmjs.org/package/httpism)

```sh
npm install httpism
```

Then

```JavaScript
var httpism = require('httpism');
```

Compatible with browserify too!

## Browser Size

* httpism.js: 20K
* httpism.min.js: 9.3K
* httpism.min.js.gz: 3.4K

## GET JSON

```JavaScript
httpism.get('http://example.com/').then(function (response) {
  console.log('json', response.body);
}, function (error) {
  console.log('uh oh', error);
});
```

## POST JSON

```JavaScript
httpism.post('http://example.com/', {name: 'Betty Boo'}).then(function (response) {
  console.log('json', response.body);
}, function (error) {
  console.log('uh oh', error);
});
```

## Create an API

Specify a base URL:

```JavaScript
var example = httpism.api('http://example.com/');

// GET http://example.com/a
example.get('a').then(function (response) {
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

Specify some options:

```JavaScript
var loggingHttpism = httpism.api({exceptions: false});

loggingHttpism.get('http://example.com/').then(function (response) {
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

Add some middleware:

```JavaScript
var authHttpism = httpism.api(function (request, next) {
  request.url += '?apikey=myapikey';
  return next();
});

// GET https://secretapi.com/?apikey=myapikey
authHttpism.get('https://secretapi.com/').then(function (response) {
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

See more about [apis](#apis).

## In the Browser

The browser version has a few differences from the node version:

* Relative URLs are relative to the current browser location.
* No support for streams.
* Redirects aren't optional, browsers _always_ follow redirects.
* Logging is removed, since most (if not all?) browsers now have a network debug tab.

However, everything else works as described here.

## Debug

httpism uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) so you can enable logging just by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to `httpism:*`:

```bash
DEBUG=httpism* node app.js
```

* `httpism` simple request => response, i.e. `GET http://www.example.com/api => 200 (40ms)`
* `httpism:request` the request
* `httpism:response` the response

More information in debug's README.

## Requests

### GET, HEAD, DELETE

```JavaScript
httpism.method (url, [options])
response.method (url, [options])
```

* `url` a string url, full or relative to the response, or '' to request the response again
* `options` request options, see [options](#options).
* `response` a response from another request.

returns a promise

### POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS

```JavaScript
httpism.method (url, body, [options])
response.method (url, body, [options])
```

* `url` a string url, full or relative to the response, or '' to request the response again
* `body` the request body to send
    * by default a JS object is encoded as JSON and sent as `application/json`
    * a JS object with options `{form: true}` is url-encoded and sent as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
    * a stream (where `typeof(stream.pipe) === 'function'`) is sent as is. Be sure to set `Content-Type` header: `{headers: {'content-type': '...'}}`.
* `options` request options, see [options](#options).
* `response` a response from another request.

### Send

```js
httpism.send(method, url, [body], [options]);
response.send(method, url, [body], [options]);
```

* `url` a string url, full or relative to the response, or '' to request the response again
* `body` the request body to send
    * by default a JS object is encoded as JSON and sent as `application/json`
    * a JS object with options `{form: true}` is url-encoded and sent as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
    * a stream (where `typeof(stream.pipe) === 'function'`) is sent as is. Be sure to set `Content-Type` header: `{headers: {'content-type': '...'}}`.
* `options` request options, see [options](#options).
* `response` a response from another request.


## Responses

Responses are objects that contain

* `statusCode` the status code as an integer, such as `200`, or `404`.
* `statusText` the status text, such as `OK` or `Not Found`.
* `url` the full URL of the response. In the browser, this will be root-relative if the request is for the same domain as the current page. This can be different to the `request.url` if there was a redirect.
* `headers` the headers of the response
* `body` the body of the response. Depending on the `Content-Type` header:
    * `application/json` a object
    * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` a object
    * `text/*` or `application/javascript` a string
    * on the server, anything else is returned as a Node stream, **be careful to close it!**. In the browser, anything else is returned as a string.

## Cookies

Cookies on the server are not handled by default, but you can enable them by using `httpism.api` passing the `{cookies: true}` option:

```js
var client = httpism.api('http://example.com/', {cookies: true});

client.post('/login', {username: 'jerome', password: 'password123'}, {form: true}).then(function () {
  return client.get('/profile').then(function (profileResponse) {
    console.log(profileResponse.body);
  });
});
```

Different instances of httpism APIs will use different cookie jars.

Cookies are always on in the browser, using native browser cookies.

## Hypermedia

All responses are full `httpism` clients, just with their base URI set to the HREF of the response. They respond to all the HTTP methods, as well as `api()`, see [apis](#apis) below.

```JavaScript
httpism.get('http://example.com/api/').then(function (api) {
  // api.body is:
  // {
  //   "documentsLink": "documents"
  // }

  // so we navigate to http://example.com/api/documents
  api.get(api.body.documentsLink).then(function (documents) {
    console.log('documents', documents.body);
  });
});
```

## Options

* `exceptions`: default `true`, throw exceptions on reception of 400-500 status codes. Set to `false` to simply return the response.
* `redirect`: default `true`, follow redirects for 300, 301, 302, 303 and 307 status codes with `Location` response headers. Set to `false` to simply return the redirect response.
* `headers`: default `undefined`, can be set to an object that is merged with middleware headers.
* `basicAuth`: use Basic Authentication, pass an object `{ username: 'bob', password: "bob's secret" }`.
* `querystring`: default `undefined`, can be set to an object containing fields that are URL-encoded and merged with the querystring already on the URL, if any.
* `form`: when `true`, treats the incoming JSON data as a form and encodes it as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
* `responseBody`: can be used to force the parsing of the response, ignoring the `Content-Type`, it can be a string of one of the following:
    * `'stream'`: always downloads the response as a stream
    * `'json'`: always parses the response as a JSON object
    * `'text'`: always parses the response as text
    * `'form'`: always parses the response as a URL-encoded form
    * `undefined`: parse response based on `Content-Type`, the default.
* `proxy`: a proxy URL, if present all requests will be run through the proxy. This works if the environment variable `http_proxy` is set too.
* `http`: default `undefined`, object containing options that are passed to [Node.js http.request()](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback).
    Many of these options are ignored by default, so you should set `agent: undefined` to force a new agent to honour the options.
* `https`: default `undefined`, object containing options that are passed to [Node.js https.request()](http://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_request_options_callback).
    Many of these options are ignored by default, so you should set `agent: undefined` to force a new agent to honour the options.
* `jsonReviver`: a [reviver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) that is passed to `JSON.parse(string, [reviver])` to override how JSON response bodies are decoded.

## APIs

API clients give you a way to build or customise a HTTP client for the purpose of accessing a particular web API. Web APIs will often have special authorization, headers, or URL conventions that are common across all calls, and you only want to have to specify those things once.

You can create API clients, either from `httpism`, giving you a fairly complete HTTP client, or from `httpism.raw` giving you no frills streaming HTTP client to do what you will with. 

```JavaScript
var api = httpism.api([url], [options], [middleware]);
var api = httpism.raw.api([url], [options], [middleware]);
var api = response.api([url], [options], [middleware]);
```

* `url` a URL string, which could be relative to the response, or absolute.
* `options` options object to be used for all calls with this api. If `api` is called on a response, the options are merged with that responses api.
* `middleware` a middleware function or array of middleware functions. Requests in middleware are processed from the beginning of the array to the end, and responses from the end of the array to the beginning. See [middleware](#middleware). Middleware specified on the new api is _prepended_ to the middleware currently in the api.

* `httpism` is the basic client, with all the goodies described above.
* `httpism.raw` is a raw client that has no other middleware.
* `response` is a response from another request.

## Middleware

Middleware commonly works like this:

```JavaScript
function middleware(request, next, httpism) {
  // change request
  request.url = ...;
  return next().then(function (response) {
    // change response
    response.body = ...;
    return response;
  });
}
```

Middlewares are ordered, and each one can have a name, and a preference to be placed before or after other named middleware.

```js
middleware.middleware = 'middleware name';
middleware.before = 'http';
middleware.after = 'redirect';
```

* `request` is an object with the following properties:
    * `url` the full URL of the request, e.g. `http://example.com/path?query=value`
    * `method` the method of the request, e.g. `GET` or `POST`
    * `headers` the headers of the request as an object. All headers are lower-cased as per Node.js conventions. E.g. `{ 'content-type': 'application/json' }`
    * `options` the [options](#options) as passed through from the request, either from the **api** or the individual request. E.g. `{exceptions: true}`.
    * `body` the body of the request. Will be `undefined` for `get()` etc, otherwise will be the object specified as the second argument to methods like `post()`.
* `next([request])` is a function that passes control onto the next middleware, optionally taking a request parameter. If the request parameter is not given it uses the request passed in to the middleware. It returns a promise of the [response](#responses).
* `httpism` is a **httpism api** object, for which you can make further requests inside the middleware. For example, the redirect middleware uses this.
* `middleware.middleware` is the name of the middleware, which can be referred to by other middlewares when adding themselves with `before` or `after`.
* `middleware.before` ensure that the middleware is inserted just before the named middleware.
* `middleware.after` ensure that the middleware is inserted just after the named middleware.

### Existing Middleware

The following middleware are available in `var middleware = require('httpism/middleware')`:

* `middleware.json` sends and receives JSON objects as `application/json`, also sets `Accept: application/json` on request.
* `middleware.text` sends strings as `text/plain` and receives strings when `text/*` or `application/javascript`.
* `middleware.exception` throws an exception when the response status code is 400-500.
* `middleware.logger` logs requests and responses.
* `middleware.redirect` follows redirects.
* `middleware.headers` honours `options.headers`.
* `middleware.form` when `options.form == true` sends and receives URL-encoded JS objects `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
* `middleware.querystring` merges the URL-encoded `options.querystring` into the request URL.
